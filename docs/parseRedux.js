This indicates success from efforts made during the COVID emergency, which has been a difficult time for outreach.  \nPrior to the COVID emergency, ALL Kids also participated in professional association conferences within the state to provide education to our partners and communities regarding ALL Kids.  Throughout the year, ALL Kids also sent applications and brochures to schools, agencies, community partners and families in Alabama.\n\n\n",

While all of these issues presented roadblocks for continuing to work to implement the program, there were successes experienced in the first full year of program implementation. Some of those successes include securing sustainable support systems and healthcare mentors for very young, disadvantaged enrollees such as a 13-year-old pregnant girl who presented with no plans for attending school and furthering her education.  She had no reliable adult support systems, and very little knowledge of how to access healthcare systems in her own community; her 28-year-old mother had no knowledge of how to best help her daughter.  Through the work of the HSI care coordinators, there is now in place a formalized home school curriculum, community support program, and personnel to mentor her within the healthcare system during her pregnancy and identified support programs and personnel to link her and her baby to needed resource post-delivery.",

This includes the 11.5% associated with Section 3004 of the Healthy Kids Act which amended Section 2105(b) of the Social Security Act specifying that the enhanced FMAP would be calculated by adding 11.5% to the State's FMAP provided under section 1905(b) of the SSA for the period 10/1/19 to 9/30/20.\nAlso, due to covid, we received an enhanced FMAP of 4.34% effective 1/1/20.  This enhancement will continue to the last day of the quarter when the national emergency is ended.  As far as enrollment projections go, we have based our projections on the average % increase.  However, as the public health emergency ends, and schools reopen, we anticipate seeing greater enrollment numbers and higher expenditures going forward.

These allowed for (among other things): modifying telehealth capacity to allow services regardless of the origination of the service, temporary modifications for health care professional licensing , allowing Medicaid-providers greater flexibility in provision of care and extending pre-existing authorizations.
