The plan was to begin outreach efforts by contacting/visiting schools to advise/remind them about the ALL Kids program, and to have them add ALL Kids contact information and a link to our website to their website, social media posts, etc.  Outreach and Retention Workers began developing materials targeted to schools and researching points of contact within the schools.  \nWhile there is not currently a formal measure for effectiveness in place, ALL Kids has been added to one of the state’s largest school district webpages under school health resources. This indicates success from efforts made during the COVID emergency, which has been a difficult time for outreach.  \nPrior to the COVID emergency, ALL Kids also participated in professional association conferences within the state to provide education to our partners and communities regarding ALL Kids.  Throughout the year, ALL Kids also sent applications and brochures to schools, agencies, community partners and families in Alabama.\n\n\n"

Children in this cohort must be 16 years and 0 months or younger when they enroll to ensure they don't age out of the program by the end of the 18-month tracking period. \nYou’ll identify a new cohort every two years. This year you’ll report on the number of children at the start of the cohort (Jan - Mar 2020) and six months later (July - Sept 2020).

While all of these issues presented roadblocks for continuing to work to implement the program, there were successes experienced in the first full year of program implementation. Some of those successes include securing sustainable support systems and healthcare mentors for very young, disadvantaged enrollees such as a 13-year-old pregnant girl who presented with no plans for attending school and furthering her education.  She had no reliable adult support systems, and very little knowledge of how to access healthcare systems in her own community; her 28-year-old mother had no knowledge of how to best help her daughter.  Through the work of the HSI care coordinators, there is now in place a formalized home school curriculum, community support program, and personnel to mentor her within the healthcare system during her pregnancy and identified support programs and personnel to link her and her baby to needed resource post-delivery."
