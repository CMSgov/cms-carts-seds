# cms-carts-seds


## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](./.images/architecture.svg?raw=true)

## Required Tools

You will need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and to make things easier you should have [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed

This project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as a package manager. Make sure to install it globally. No not use npm or commit any package-lock files

You will need docker installed. either with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or may we suggest the [docker desktop](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)

You will need [serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) installed globally. `npm install -g serverless`

## Environments

 The `master` branch reflects our latest product. On merge to `master`, the dev environment is deployed and tested in Amazon. When the `master` build succeeds, the commit on `master` is tagged in git as a candidate release version.
 
 There are three primary environments
 - Production - [https://mdctcarts.cms.gov/](https://mdctcarts.cms.gov/)
 - Val (staging) - [https://mdctcartsval.cms.gov/](https://mdctcartsval.cms.gov/)
 - Dev - [https://mdctcartsdev.cms.gov/](https://mdctcartsdev.cms.gov/)
 
## Continuous Integration and Deployment

Jenkins is used to deploy the various releasses from master into their respective environments
- [http://internal-jenkins-cartsseds-1894071124.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/](http://internal-jenkins-cartsseds-1894071124.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/)

When a version needs to be deployed to staging or production select the desired pipeline and choose `deploy with parameters` inserting the release number you wish to deploy.


## Some development notes

Development will be done on feature/bugfix branches that will be submitted as PRs. Accepted PRs will be merged to the `master` branch.

A PR must be reviewed and approved by someone other than the submitter. The submitting developer is responsible for merging it to `master` once the PR has been approved and all comments have been resolved.

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting. Uee format_on_save functionality or run `npx prettier --write /path/to/file` on your files before submitting your PR

## Set up

1. Clone this repository
1. Navigate to the cloned repository
   - `cd cms-carts-seds`
1. Ensure you are in the `master` branch

## Start Up Localhost with Django/Postgres Backend

1. Navigate to the 'frontend' subfolder
   - `cd frontend`
1. Connect a container to the network (only necessary on first build)
   - `docker network create data_net`
1. Build your services
 - `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build`
1. Access the project
 - Visit the react frontend at http://localhost:81
 - Visit the Django api at http://localhost:8000
 - The local postgres db is available at localhost:5432
 
 
 ## Connect to db and Insert starter data
 
 Connect to the db running at localhost:5432 via a PostgreSQL admin tool such as [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/). user: `postgres` password not required
 You will need to import some some additional data into your db:
 - download this [file](https://qmacbis.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~46767958/pages/2803499013/CARTS+-+starter+db+data)
 - in your db admin tool choose the `public` schema
 - select the option to restore data from file
 - choose the file you just downloaded
 - in the restore options select to only import the data
 - the data should be imported into the existing tables. NOTE: the process may report as having failed but should still import the data


## Available Endpoints:

   - `/api/v1/sections/<int:year>/<str:state>`: all the sections for a year and state, e.g. `/api/v1/sections/2020/ak`.
   - `/api/v1/sections/<int:year>/<str:state>/<int:section>`: the section for that year and state, e.g. `/api/v1/sections/2020/ak/1`.
   - `/api/v1/sections/<int:year>/<str:state>/<int:section>/<str:subsection>`: the subsection for that year and state, e.g. `/api/v1/sections/2020/az/3/c`.
   - `/api/v1/questions/<str:state>/<slug:id>`: e.g. `/api/v1/questions/ma/2020-03-c-01-01`.
   - `/api/v1/generic-sections/<int:year>`: all the default sections for a year e.g. `/api/v1/generic-sections/2020`.
   - `/api/v1/generic-sections/<int:year>/<int:section>`: the default section for that year e.g. `/api/v1/generic-sections/2020/1`.
   - `/api/v1/generic-sections/<int:year>/<int:section>/<str:subsection>`: the default subsection for that year e.g. `/api/v1/generic-sections/2020/1/a`.
   - `/api/v1/generic-questions/<slug:id>`: the default corresponding question, e.g. `/api/v1/generic-questions/2020-01-a-01`.

   Currently only Sections 1, 2, 3 (incomplete) and 5 are available, and only mock data for AK, AZ, and MA is available.

   Append `?format=json` to the URLs to get bare JSON.

## Available Routes:
   - `/sections/:year/:sectionOrdinal/:subsectionMarker` e.g. `http://localhost:81/sections/2020/3/c`
   - `/sections/:year/:sectionOrdinal/` e.g. `http://localhost:81/sections/2020/3`
1. Okta authentication: add `?dev=dev-ak` to the URL in order to bypass the Okta authentication and view the application as a fake user from Alaska; `dev-az` and `dev-ma` are also supported values for the `dev` parameter that will provide fake users for those states.

### Running the React Test Suite

1. Navigate to the front end
   1. `cd frontend\react\src`
2. Launch the test runner in interactive watch mode.
   1. Run `npm test`
   2. Press `a` to run all tests.
